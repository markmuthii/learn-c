# LEARNING C

I've been writing code for almost 8 years now. In that time, I have mostly focused on web development, and while the web has played its part, it's time for a new challenge. 

Don't get me wrong, the web is great. But I want a deeper understanding of software engineering. Hence the decision to start learning C. I want to get as close to machine language as possible, preferably while maintaining my sanity. 

## The Plan

The idea is simple: learn the mother language, and most core software engineering concepts using it.

I am currently following [The C Programming Handbook for Beginners](https://freecodecamp.com/news/the-c-programming-handbook-for-beginners) to get the foundational concepts out of the way first. 

Then, the next thing will be to follow The Coding Interview University roadmap, still using C as the programming language.

This repo will be how I keep track of everything.

## Spice

To spice things up, I have decided to only use Linux and Vim (Neovim) for everything that I am going to be doing over the next several months.  

At the moment, I have set up Ubuntu on my windows machine through WSL, but the hope is that I can later get a different machine specifically for running Linux on (I do not want to dual boot or use a VM).

Let's see how this goes :).
